## Proposal

Allocate ROOK, USDC, and ETH for KeeperDAO Labs for March through June 2022.

## Background

The number of KeeperDAO Labs Individual Contributors (ICs) has grown considerably, and we plan to continue scaling over the new few months. This budget outlines current and forecasted needs for various areas of operations over the budget period.

This budget, if approved, will be transferred from the KeeperDAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the KeeperDAO Labs multisig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) which is then used to pay ICs on Mondays (or when an *ad hoc* project is completed). The current signers of the KeeperDAO Labs multisig are @WhatsTheDeetz, @Pai-Sho, and @JZ.

The breakdown of the ROOK budget is given below, with more detail provided in subsections.

| Team | Total (ROOK) |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Product and Engineering | 1040 |
| Growth and Operations | 720 |
| People Operations | 500 |
| Grants | 150 |
| Treasury | 180 |
| Studio | 240 |
| Marketing and Brand | 600 |
| Grand Total | 3430 |


### Product and Engineering: 1040 ROOK

We use ROOK grants for all part-time engineering roles. Currently, we have 3 engineering contractors who are paid weekly at 10 ROOK/week. We estimate that we have management capacity for 5 - 8 engineering contractors. This budget allows for the maximum (8).

| IC Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| -------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |
| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |
| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |

| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |
| Webflow | 10 | 200 |
| Designer | 10 | 120 |
| Backend engineer | 10 | 120 |

### Growth and Operations: 720 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles in business development, customer service, DAO engagement, and governance. Additionally, we intend to use ROOK grants for those wishing to start on the path to a full-time role.

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Business development | 20 | 240 |
| Operations | 40 | 480 |

### People Operations: 500 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles including technical recruiters and process coordinators, in addition to bridging part-time contribution to full-time contribution. In addition, we expect this ROOK budget may be required for other recruiting expenses, including placement fees of up to 25% of the first year salary of a new hire (for certain recruiting firms).

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Workplace |   --    | 500 |


### Community Grants: 150 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants to fund small projects that foster community growth, accelerate development, discover and support partners, translations, or other ad hoc projects.

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Community grants |   --    | 150 |

### Treasury: 180 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for bridging part-time to full-time work, in support of the treasury functions of the DAO.

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Treasury analyst |   10    | 120 |
| Treasury analyst |   5    | 60 |


### Studio: 240 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for bridging part-time to full-time work, on a studio team that can fuel high-quality, in-house content generation. This content will help to consistently communicate our brand, mission, and values, as well as cementing our partnerships and mythos. Weâ€™ll be seeking to onboard for design and production roles to flesh out our creative skillsets, and commission projects in the interim.

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Video producer |   10    | 120 |
| UX designer |   10    | 120 |


### Marketing and Branding: 600 ROOK

We intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for briding part-time to full-time work supporting a marketing function. Additional ROOK budget is required for various advertising and sponsorship needs that will ramp up our marketing efforts ahead of the launch of the Coordination Game.

| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Research |   --    | 100 |
| UX designer |   --    | 500 |


### USDC Needs: 500,000

Over the budget period, we forsee the need to spend USDC on placement fees, contractors and vendors who do not take ROOK, conferences, and advertisements.

| Description  | Total (USDC) |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Contractors and recruiting | 462,500.00 |
| Events |  5000.00 |
| Conferences | 8000.00 |
| Team reimbursements | 25,000.00 |
| Total | 500,500.00 |

### ETH Needs: 1

We intend to use 1 ETH for network fees incurred during the transfer of grants over the budget period.

| Description  | Total (ETH) |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Gas | 1 |

### Excess ROOK and USDC Rollover

The budget above represents in all cases an upper bound. It isn't required that we spend all of it, and we do not seek to. If excess ROOK or USDC exists at the end of the budget period, it will carry over into the subsequent budget period unless superceded by another KIP.


## Specification

1. Transfer 3430 ROOK, 500,500 USDC and 1 ETH (for gas) from the KeeperDAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the KeeperDAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006).
2. As appropriate, provide funding from the KeeperDAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) to meet the needs outlined above during the budget period.
3. Ensure good recordkeeping to provide for review of any transactions by the DAO.
