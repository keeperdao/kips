## Preface

### Proposal

Lower the minimum objection voting period from 7 days to 3 days.

### Background

Governance is thriving as well as gaining interest, but it is also accruing a backlog of KIP drafts. The overall cadence of the governance process is slowed by a 7 day open no objection voting period, while it seems nearly all participation occurs within the first 48 to 72 hours. If our goal is to be frictionless with agreement, and slower-moving with more opaque consensus, we should lower the minimum objection period for a vote to 72 hours, while letting Sophons choose to use the customary week for more hotly contested subjects.


## Specification

1. Lower minimum objection voting period to 72 hours, while allowing Sophons to choose another period (such as the current 7 day period) where consensus is less clear.
