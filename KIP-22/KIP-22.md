Introduction

Hey Keeper DAO community

I’m Théo from mStable. mStable is a Decentralized Stablecoins Ecosystem, designed to produce sustainable yield on USD.

A couple of weeks ago, we initiated with @hazard & @DaddyMatty a discussion about Keeper DAO Treasury which led to me coming to you today with a diversification/utilization idea for a portion of the treasury stablecoin currently sitting idle in the treasury

## Context

Keeper DAO & mStable DAO have been collaborating during the past weeks on a product partnership that would use a new version of Keeper magic MEV bots inside the mStable AMM.

In parallel to this, Keeper DAO Treasury was also brought into the discussion as mStable beyond its AMM, has a high-yielding savings account product, relevant for Treasury utilization.
Both teams agreed that diversification could be a great start, part of a broader scheme of close collaborations between the mStable and Keeper DAOs.

## Stablecoins and DAOs

It has come to our understanding that we’re in the early days of DAO Treasury Management, driven by the fact the observation that DAO treasuries have grown enormously in very little time, with tooling available to them being fragmented, suboptimal and incomplete

Within this framework, we think that it is sensible to expand the use of stablecoins within DAO treasuries. Stablecoins realize the value accrued within the treasury, secure the protocol OPEX and offer long-run stability against market cycles. Beyond that, they give the opportunity to create sources of non-operating income while enabling opportunistic investment behaviours that create value for the DAO (e.g. buying the dip, token buybacks, etc.)

## mStable and battle-tested stablecoin utilization

Making stablecoins an integral part of a DAO’s diversification strategy will enable a path towards the DAO’s long-run sustainability but it requires adequate tooling.

mStable is a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem producing sustainable yield on USD. The protocol has been operating for 22 months without interruption or hacks and is one of the safest projects in DeFi for stablecoins. As well, mStable scored 97% on the Defi Safety Score, a stupendous score.

The project is backed by Three Arrows Capital, DACM, DeFiance Capital & Alameda Research among others.

Save APY has historically been around 15%, significantly outperforming competition (Yearn, Aave or Curve). Please check this link for more granular historic performance details (Dune dashboard [here](https://dune.com/naddison/mStable-imUSD-returns)).

## About Save strategy

mStable deposits 98% of mUSD’s underlying assets to established lending markets to earn a base interest rate. This rate is then further increased by distributing mStable Swap fees and liquidating external protocol incentives.

mUSD exposition is:

* 51% to Aave
* 49% to Compound

If we break down Save APY, 55% of it is coming from lending interest revenues on Aave & Compound, 22.5% from our AMM swap fees & the remaining 22.5% from platform rewards liquidation. It would mean that 25% of Save yield is independent of lending protocol and their inherent risk. Save APY is hence fully organic, market-neutral and ultra-consistent.

## Keeper DAO opportunity with mStable

mStable Save is a stablecoin-agnostic savings platform for DAOs.
Looking closely at Keeper treasury, we think such a utilization move could make sense.

Indeed, 29.3% of Keeper DAO Treasury 79m+ is composed of stablecoins. Of this 34%, $3.3m DAI is already used. There is still $5.2m USD that could be utilised.

Considering the existing healthy structure of the treasury (Stablecoins being 1/3 of the total treasury) and the re-collateralization backstop protecting the $ROOK token, the protocol could definitely explore moving a significant part of its available stablecoins

## Rationale & Scenario analysis

According to a post from october post, Keeper DAO yearly burn rate reaches $740,499 which would take a $4.93m allocation at a Hey 15% rate (mStable Save APY) to cover it fully.

Keeper DAO could think about then allocating between 50% and 80% of these 5.6m to cover (partially or fully) the DAO yearly expenses

To get started, we recommend that KeeperDAO deposit funds in tranches of $500,000 on a quarterly basis for a period of the community’s choosing. Using current data, this would result in an estimated annual yield of $210,595 if done for a full year.

With 4 tranches of 500k over a year, the treasury would increase its treasury by $210,595 over a year which would be an 11% marginal rate (Save proceeds are automatically compounded). 

Please find below:

## Benefits

Basically, with the aforementioned amount deposited into Save, Keeper DAO could pay with mStable Save APY its yearly contributors capital requirement

More generally, benefits would be:

* Passive management of treasury
* Consistently strong APY
* Long-term protocol value growth
* Trustless contract
* Non-operating revenue stream
* Seamless treasury management

## Closing thoughts

We would love KeeperDAO to be part of mStable Save. This product is a work in progress, improving it together will be mutually beneficial and will shape the future of DAOs economics and sustainability.

Happy to get into details and answer any questions you might have :slight_smile:
