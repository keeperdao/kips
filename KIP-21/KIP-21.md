## Background 
KIP-12 [1] empowered key contributors to expand and organize KeeperDAO during the first quarter of 2022.

As documented in [2], during the first quarter of 2022, the number of full time contributors was doubled, the number of products was halved, and the number of partnerships and integrations increased 700%. The internal organizational structure was overhauled from the bottom-up, and major engineering progress was made on all fronts.

This proposal extends the powers delegated in KIP-12 for another quarter, through 30 June 2022, or until superceded.

## Specification 
1. Extend KIP-12 until the end of Q2 2022, that is, midnight UTC on 30 June, 2022.
